This R script is designed to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) datasets and correct for batch effects using the Seurat package. 
The script starts by setting the working directory and loading essential libraries like Seurat, ggplot2, and tidyverse. 
It then reads multiple scRNA-Seq datasets from the specified directory, creating Seurat objects for each dataset.
The datasets are merged into a single Seurat object, followed by quality control (QC) and filtering to remove low-quality cells based on RNA count, feature count, and mitochondrial content. 
The script normalizes the data, identifies variable features, and scales the data, then performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to visualize any batch effects.
To correct batch effects, the merged dataset is split by patient, and each subset is normalized and processed to identify variable features. Integration features are selected, and integration anchors are identified using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). The data is then integrated, scaled, and analyzed using PCA and UMAP to visualize the corrected data.
Finally, the script generates UMAP plots before and after integration to compare the results, displaying these plots in a grid layout.
